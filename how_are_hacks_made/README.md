# How are hacks made
This file will explain everything about how hacks are really made.

## Good things to know before we start
Everything you need to know.
### Terms
Assembly is a language your OS reads while running the program. and are the weird characters you see when opening an exe file in a text editor (This is in it's raw state. To read the real assembly behind it you need tools).  
  
Reverse engineering is a term used for when people are reading the assembly to understand how the code works.  
### Tools
IDA (pro) is a program used to reverse engineer the assembly.  
  
HxD is a tool used a lot for editing the bytes of the game.  
  
Cheat Engine is a program which allows you to search up values and byte offsets in the memory.
## Finding the right bytes
The most common ways hackers find the right bytes to edit is by either using ida to search for the code by searching around functions calls and string calls which are related to the codes they want to edit or by using cheat engine to find where the codes are in the memory which handles certain values. After finding the right codes they start reading the codes and look for the exact instructions they need to edit to get the behaviour the want.
