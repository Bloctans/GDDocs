# Encryptions
All encryption info you need to decrypt all Geometry Dash encryptions.

## Common words
Raw: this means the encrypted string without any changes being made to it.  
  
Base64 (encode/decode): This is an encoding like hexadecimal (which is base16). It's mostly used in Geometry Dash as the last encoding since it's safe to transfar through URLs.  
  
XOR: This is an encryption which makes the string 8-bit ASCII IDs (also known as binary) and compares 2 binary string numbers at the time of the 2 bits next to each other (a bit is 8 1/0 characters in a row in binary) and looks if they are the same (0) or different (1) and repeats that for every 2 bits 8 times to go through all numbers of the bits and the result will be a new string of bits as the result of the comparing outputs.
